#  Seq2Seq Translation

##  Implement By Bidirectional GRU And Transformer In Pytorch

### Before You Run The Code

You should download the data through the link below.

https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ptpghzFEAQIS4A_5EDF_0g 
Retrieve Code is 1916.

Then put them in the right place. Just like 

> seq2seq_translation/seq2seq_translation_gru/data/chs-eng-cut.txt

>seq2seq_translation/seq2seq_translation_transformer/data/train.txt

Run the train.py to start training.

If you want to use your own dataset, just replace the file you download and make it same format as mine.

(for each line in data file “src + ‘\t’ + trg”) 

##  At last, thanks to the public dataset this project based on, news-commentary-v14, wikititles-v1 and translation2019zh-train.
